# Snippet Training

I will try to cover all these topics in 4 languages, C#, C++, and Java. If I have completed it, there should be a link to the executable, respective to the language. I will be doing the following:

- Binary Tree: [C#](https://github.com/pgonzbecer/snippet-training/tree/master/cs#binarytree) - [Java](https://github.com/pgonzbecer/snippet-training/tree/master/java#binarytree) - [C++](https://github.com/pgonzbecer/snippet-training/tree/master/cpp#binarytree)
- HashTable: [C#](https://github.com/pgonzbecer/snippet-training/tree/master/cs#hashtable) - [Java](https://github.com/pgonzbecer/snippet-training/tree/master/java#hashtable) - [C++](https://github.com/pgonzbecer/snippet-training/tree/master/cpp#hashtable)
- Lists and Arrays
  - Sorting: [C#](https://github.com/pgonzbecer/snippet-training/tree/master/cs#sorting) - [Java](https://github.com/pgonzbecer/snippet-training/tree/master/java#sorting) - [C++](https://github.com/pgonzbecer/snippet-training/tree/master/cpp#sorting)
  - Removing duplication: [C#](https://github.com/pgonzbecer/snippet-training/tree/master/cs#listremoveduplication) - [Java](https://github.com/pgonzbecer/snippet-training/tree/master/java#listremoveduplication) - [C++](https://github.com/pgonzbecer/snippet-training/tree/master/cpp#listremoveduplication)
  - Quick search with sorted version
- Permutation of strings
- A thing that checks if you won Sudoku
- Graphs: It's almost the same, but I have done some shortest path stuff [here](https://github.com/pgonzbecer/Conquest), with the source being [here, it's near the bottom](https://github.com/pgonzbecer/Conquest/blob/master/src/Conquest/Maps/HexGrid.cs). It's [Lee algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_algorithm) though.
  - A*
  - Dijkstra
- AVL Tree

Bonus Stuff

- Fibinacci Sequence
- Any other sequences
- Red-Black Trees
- Factorials: [C#](https://github.com/pgonzbecer/snippet-training/tree/master/cs#factorials) - [Java](https://github.com/pgonzbecer/snippet-training/tree/master/java#factorials) - [C++](https://github.com/pgonzbecer/snippet-training/tree/master/cpp#factorials)

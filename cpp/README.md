# C++ Snippet Training

This folder is where all the executables are at for the C++ version of the snippet training. Do note that I understand the concept of C++, but not fully. I am missing some vital information that makes some of these non-functional.

### <a href="#binarytree"></a>BinaryTree

The binary tree creates an array of 20 random integers, and displays it. This one is best opened via command prompt

### <a href="hashtable"></a>HashTable

A hash table that loads in about 150 different keys and values, and displays it. You can type in a key to find it. Although I was unsuccessful to get it working in C++ :/.

### <a href="#factorials"></a>Factorials

A simple program that intakes an integer and gets the factorial out of it. 170! is the limit. Typing any non-integers will exit the program

### <a href="#listremoveduplication"></a>ListRemoveDuplication

This program is supposed to remove any and all duplications, although it doesn't function correctly, for some reason. So it will repeat whatever you typed into it. This one you need to use the command prompt in order to type in an array with it.

### <a href="#sorting"></a>Sorting

This program is supposed to sort out an array of 20 random integers, but again, I did not do it correctly, and crashes :/. This one is best opened via command prompt

This folder is where all the executables are at for the Java version of the snippet training. Do note that Java is the second strongest language I know.

A hash table with the size of 50, takes in 500 different keys and values. You can type in an integer key to find the associated value.

### <a href="#factorials"></a>Factorials

A simple program that intakes an integer and gets the factorial out of it. 170! is the limit. Typing 'exit' will exit the program

### <a href="#listremoveduplication"></a>ListRemoveDuplication

This program basically intakes an array of strings from when you startup the application, and removes any duplications. For example, "ListRemoveDuplication 1 2 20 string word 1 left left 200 20 string" will execute with the array "1 2 20 string word 1 left left 200 20 string". This one is required to be launched from command prompt
